# TensorRT - Installation varies by platform:
#
# WINDOWS:
#   TensorRT doesn't install cleanly via pip on Windows.
#   Option 1: Use NVIDIA's pre-built wheels
#     pip install tensorrt-cu12 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
#     (or tensorrt-cu13 for CUDA 13.x / Blackwell GPUs)
#
#   Option 2: Download from NVIDIA (recommended)
#     1. Download TensorRT 10.x from https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt
#     2. Extract and add to PATH
#     3. pip install <path_to_tensorrt>/python/tensorrt-10.x.x-cp3xx-none-win_amd64.whl
#
# LINUX:
#   pip install tensorrt>=10.0.1
#
# Note: torch is assumed to be installed via ComfyUI
